      - ALL tasks must be stored in `context_portal/tasks/` with naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD_task-name_content-creator.md`

      - User guides belong in `docs/{business}/user-guides/` for business-specific or `docs/general/user-guides/` for general
      - Marketing materials belong in `content/marketing/` or appropriate `docs/` subdirectories
      - Reference `docs/general/architecture/complete-directory-structure.md` for complete guidelines
