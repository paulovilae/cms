      # 🚀 Code Mode: Structured Development Workflow

      Follow this 8-phase approach for all coding tasks. Each phase builds on the previous one to ensure quality, consistency, and maintainability.

      ---

      ## 🧠 **STEP 0: Load All MCP Memory Systems (REQUIRED FIRST)**

      **🔥 BEFORE STARTING ANY TASK, CHECK ALL MCP SYSTEMS:**

      **1. ConPort Memory System:**
      - [ ] Use `get_product_context` to load project context
      - [ ] Use `get_active_context` to check current work focus
      - [ ] Use `get_decisions` (limit 5) to review recent decisions
      - [ ] Use `get_progress` to check task status
      - [ ] **INFORM USER**: "ConPort loaded: [SUCCESS/FAILED] - [brief status]"

      **2. Encrypted Knowledge System:**
      - [ ] Use `load_folder_memory` to check existing folder knowledge
      - [ ] Review previous patterns, solutions, and known issues
      - [ ] Check folder health status and recent actions
      - [ ] **INFORM USER**: "Encrypted memory loaded: [SUCCESS/FAILED] - [brief status]"

      **3. Context7 Documentation System (when working with libraries):**
      - [ ] Use `resolve-library-id` to find library documentation when working with external libraries
      - [ ] Use `get-library-docs` to get up-to-date documentation and examples
      - [ ] **INFORM USER**: "Context7 docs loaded: [SUCCESS/FAILED] - [library name]" (only when used)

      **4. Memory Integration:**
      - [ ] Combine insights from all systems
      - [ ] Look for similar problems already solved
      - [ ] Use existing solutions and patterns to inform your approach
      - [ ] Reference current library documentation when needed

      **⚠️ CRITICAL**: Never start coding without checking MCP memory systems first! Use Context7 for library documentation. Always inform user of loading status.

      ## 📁 **CRITICAL: File Organization (MUST FOLLOW)**

      **Before starting ANY task, ensure files go in the correct locations:**

      | File Type | Location | Example |
      |-----------|----------|---------|
      | 📋 **Task Documentation** | MCP Server Only (ConPort + Encrypted Knowledge) | Use `log_decision`, `log_progress`, `save_folder_memory` |
      | 💻 **Source Code** | `src/` | `src/components/LoginForm.tsx` |
      | 🧪 **Tests** | `tests/unit/{business}/` or `tests/unit/general/` | `tests/unit/salarium/LoginForm.test.ts` |
      | 🔧 **Scripts** | `infrastructure/scripts/` | `infrastructure/scripts/deploy.sh` |
      | 📚 **Documentation** | `docs/general/` or `docs/{business}/` | `docs/general/authentication.md` |

      **📖 Reference**: See `docs/general/architecture/complete-directory-structure.md` for complete guidelines.

      ---

      ## 📖 **Phase 8: Knowledge Preservation (REQUIRED)**
      
      **Goal**: Store ALL task documentation ONLY in MCP memory systems - NO local files.

      **🧠 ConPort System Updates (PRIMARY):**
      - [ ] Use `log_decision` for architectural/implementation decisions
      - [ ] Use `log_progress` to update task status and completion
      - [ ] Use `update_active_context` with current focus changes
      - [ ] Use `log_custom_data` for patterns, solutions, and detailed task documentation
      - [ ] Use `log_system_pattern` for reusable code patterns discovered
      - [ ] **INFORM USER**: "ConPort updated: [SUCCESS/FAILED] - [what was saved]"

      **🔐 Encrypted Knowledge System Updates (SECONDARY):**
      - [ ] Use `save_folder_memory` to preserve comprehensive task documentation
      - [ ] Include complete task details: approach, solutions, patterns, issues encountered
      - [ ] Store debugging workflows, error resolutions, and prevention strategies
      - [ ] Include recent actions, folder health status, and knowledge base updates
      - [ ] **INFORM USER**: "Encrypted memory updated: [SUCCESS/FAILED] - [what was saved]"

      **🚫 NO LOCAL TASK FILES**: Do NOT create files in `context_portal/tasks/` - use MCP systems only.

      **🎯 Output**: Complete task knowledge preserved ONLY in MCP systems for maximum security and retention.

      ## ⚠️ **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**

      - ❌ Don't modify code without understanding full context
      - ❌ Don't create simplified versions without explicit request
      - ❌ Don't copy-paste code without understanding purpose
      - ❌ Don't implement single-business-context solutions
      - ❌ Don't make changes outside task scope
      - ❌ Don't skip error handling or validation
      - ❌ Don't leave unexplained TODO comments
      - ❌ Don't store files in incorrect directories

      ---

      ## 🏢 **Multi-Tenant Architecture Guidelines**

      **Our platform serves multiple businesses**: salarium, intellitrade, latinos, capacita

      **✅ Multi-Tenant Checklist:**
      - [ ] Consider which business contexts are affected
      - [ ] Maintain separation between business-specific and general code
      - [ ] Test changes across all relevant business contexts
      - [ ] Use business-specific directories when appropriate
      - [ ] Ensure business context validation in API endpoints

      ---

      ## 📝 **Final Deliverable**

      **🧠 Dual MCP Memory Workflow (MANDATORY):**

      **START OF TASK:**
      1. Load ConPort context (`get_product_context`, `get_active_context`, `get_decisions`)
      2. Load encrypted knowledge (`load_folder_memory`)
      3. Load Context7 docs when working with libraries (`resolve-library-id`, `get-library-docs`)
      4. **ALWAYS inform user of loading status for all systems**
      5. Apply existing patterns and solutions from all memory systems

      **END OF TASK:**
      1. Update ConPort with comprehensive task documentation (`log_decision`, `log_progress`, `log_custom_data`, `log_system_pattern`)
      2. Update encrypted knowledge with complete task details and learnings (`save_folder_memory`)
      3. **NO LOCAL FILES**: Store ALL task documentation in MCP systems only
      4. **ALWAYS inform user of saving status for both systems**

      **📋 Status Reporting Format:**
      - "ConPort loaded: SUCCESS - Found 3 recent decisions, active context: [focus]"
      - "Encrypted memory loaded: SUCCESS - Folder health: excellent, 5 patterns discovered"
      - "Context7 docs loaded: SUCCESS - React documentation retrieved" (only when used)
      - "ConPort updated: SUCCESS - Logged 2 decisions, updated progress"
      - "Encrypted memory updated: SUCCESS - Updated knowledge base with new solutions"

      **⚠️ CRITICAL RULE**: ALWAYS load from ConPort and encrypted MCP systems. Use Context7 when working with libraries. Always inform user of status. Store ALL task documentation ONLY in MCP systems - NO local files. This builds comprehensive institutional knowledge across all systems with maximum security.

      **🔮 Future Note**: The encrypted system may eventually replace the normal ConPort system, so maintaining both ensures smooth transition. All task documentation is now stored exclusively in MCP systems for enhanced security and centralized knowledge management.

      **Remember**: Quality code is not just working code—it's maintainable, testable, and understandable code that serves the business effectively, with knowledge properly preserved and reused through ALL MCP systems.
