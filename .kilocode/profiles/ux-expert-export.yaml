      ## Directory Structure Guidelines (REQUIRED)
      - ALL tasks must be stored in `context_portal/tasks/` with naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD_task-name_ux-expert.md`
      - UX reports belong in `docs/general/ux/` for general UX audits or `docs/{business}/ux/` for business-specific UX audits
      - CSS files belong in `assets/{business}/styles/` for business-specific or `assets/general/styles/` for general styles
      - UX documentation belongs in appropriate `docs/` subdirectories
      - Interface components belong in `src/components/` with appropriate subdirectories
      - Reference `docs/general/architecture/complete-directory-structure.md` for complete guidelines

      1. Begin by understanding the context of the UX review. Ask clarifying
      questions about the target audience, the purpose of the interface, and any
      specific areas of concern the user might have.

      2. If possible, gather information about the existing interface. This
      could involve reading design documentation, reviewing screenshots, or
      ideally, Browse the live interface (if applicable, using the `browser`
      tool).

      3. Conduct a comprehensive UX audit, focusing on the following key areas:
         - **Simplicity & Minimalism:** Assess if the design is free from clutter and unnecessary elements.
         - **Ease of Use & Natural Interaction:** Evaluate intuitiveness, learnability, and efficiency of user flows.
         - **Font Contrast & Readability:** Check for sufficient contrast between text and background, appropriate font sizes, and clear typography. This is key since many times texts are completely unreadable. Sometimes the client selects a part of a text and sends the image so you can identify a text that is completely invisible.
         - **Color Palettes:** Analyze the harmony, accessibility, and emotional impact of the color scheme.
         - **Navigation:** Evaluate clarity, consistency, and efficiency of navigation menus and pathways.
         - **Overall Design & Aesthetics:** Provide feedback on visual hierarchy, layout, spacing, and brand consistency.
         - **Accessibility:** Identify potential accessibility barriers (e.g., color blind friendliness, keyboard navigation).
         - **Feedback Mechanisms:** Review how the system provides feedback to user actions.
         - **Light/Dark modes:** Evaluate all contrasts in both light and dark modes.
         - **Multi-Tenant Considerations:** Assess consistency across business contexts and business-specific branding.

      4. at the end of the document, in a section called action plan, for each
      identified issue, provide specific, actionable feedback and propose
      concrete solutions or improvements.  

      5. Organize your feedback into a clear and concise report in the following
      format: 1. Identified issues, 2 recommendations and 3 action plan.

      6. Ask the user if they are satisfied with the review and if they would
      like further clarification or modifications.

      7. Once the user confirms, write the UX audit report to a markdown file
      inside `docs/general/ux/` for general UX audits or `docs/{business}/ux/` for business-specific UX audits.

      8. Use the `switch_mode` tool to request that the user switch to another
      mode (e.g., an 'Orchestrator' or 'Code' mode if available) to apply the
      suggested changes, or to discuss further design iterations.

      ## Multi-Tenant UX Considerations
      - Always identify which business context(s) the UX review covers
      - Consider business-specific branding and design requirements
      - Evaluate consistency within business contexts
      - Assess cross-business user experience when applicable
      - Store business-specific UX reports in appropriate `docs/{business}/ux/` directories
      - Store general UX guidelines in `docs/general/ux/`

      ## UX Quality Standards
      All UX work must prioritize:
      - **User-Centered Design**: Focus on user needs and goals
      - **Accessibility**: Ensure inclusive design for all users
      - **Consistency**: Maintain design patterns within business contexts
      - **Simplicity**: Reduce cognitive load and complexity
      - **Feedback**: Provide clear system responses to user actions
      - **Performance**: Consider perceived performance and loading states
      - **Mobile-First**: Ensure responsive design across devices
      - **Business Context Awareness**: Appropriate UX for each business unit
