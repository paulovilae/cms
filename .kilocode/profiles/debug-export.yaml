      WARNING: DO NOT CREATE SIMPLIFIED VERSION OF THE FUNCTIONS OR CODE FOR
      DEBUG PURPOSES UNLESS EXPLICITLY TOLD SO BY THE END USER!!!  Usually the
      simplified versions do not have the needed functionality and restoring the
      full version can be  challenge or even impossible.

      Follow this structured debugging workflow:

      ## Directory Structure Guidelines (REQUIRED)
      - ALL tasks must be stored in `context_portal/tasks/` with naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD_task-name_debug.md`
      - Source code fixes belong in `src/` directory
      - Tests belong in `tests/` directory with business-specific subdirectories
      - Infrastructure fixes belong in `infrastructure/` directory
      - Documentation updates belong in `docs/` with appropriate subdirectories
      - Reference `docs/general/architecture/complete-directory-structure.md` for complete guidelines

      ## 1. Reproduce (REQUIRED)
      - Clearly understand and reliably reproduce the issue
      - Identify the exact conditions under which the bug occurs
      - Document the reproduction steps clearly in your task file
      - Determine if the issue is business-context specific
      - Identify which components are involved
      - Test across multiple business contexts if relevant

      ## 2. Isolate (REQUIRED)
      - Narrow down the problem to specific components or lines of code
      - Use binary search techniques to isolate the issue
      - Add strategic logging to gather data about the problem area
      - Look for patterns of similar issues in the codebase
      - Check the multi-tenant configuration if relevant
      - Examine business-specific vs. general code paths

      ## 3. Root Cause Analysis (REQUIRED)
      - Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem
      - Distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources
      - Add logs to validate your assumptions
      - Explicitly ask the user to confirm the diagnosis before fixing
      - Document the evidence supporting your diagnosis
      - Consider how the issue might affect other business contexts
      - Check for similar patterns in other parts of the codebase

      ## 4. Fix Implementation
      - Make targeted, minimal changes to address the root cause
      - Avoid introducing new complexity
      - Add comments explaining why the fix works
      - DO NOT CREATE SIMPLIFIED VERSIONS of functions unless explicitly requested
      - Ensure the fix works across all business contexts
      - Preserve existing business-specific behavior
      - Store fixes in appropriate directories (`src/`, `infrastructure/`, etc.)
      
      ## 5. Verification (REQUIRED)
      - Verify the fix resolves the issue in the original context
      - Test related functionality to ensure no regressions
      - Verify in multiple business contexts if applicable
      - Test edge cases specifically
      - Document the verification process
      - Create or update tests in `tests/` directory to prevent regression

      ## 6. Prevention (REQUIRED)
      - Add automated tests to prevent regression in appropriate `tests/` subdirectories
      - Document the root cause and solution in `docs/` directory
      - Identify similar patterns elsewhere in the codebase
      - Recommend systemic improvements to prevent similar issues
      - Update error handling patterns if needed
      - Create a reusable troubleshooting guide for this class of issue

      ## 7. Systematic Verification Across Similar Files (REQUIRED)
      - When implementing a fix to any file, immediately identify and review ALL similar or related files that may have the same issue
      - Use search tools to locate files with similar patterns, naming conventions, or functionality
      - Apply consistent fixes across all identified files to prevent recurring issues
      - Verify that configuration changes (YAML, JSON, etc.) are applied uniformly across all relevant files
      - Document which files were modified together and the rationale for consistency
      - Create a checklist of related files that should be reviewed for any future similar issues
      - When debugging, search for similar code patterns that may have the same bug
      - When fixing structural issues, ensure consistent resolution across all business contexts or similar components
      - Proactively prevent the same issue from manifesting in related files

      ## 8. Knowledge Transfer (REQUIRED)
      - Document lessons learned in your task file in `context_portal/tasks/`
      - Create a diagnostic decision tree for similar issues
      - Record every solution with detailed context
      - Create a solutions pattern that others can reference
      - Flag any remaining risks or potential issues
      - Update relevant documentation in `docs/` directory

      ## Docker-Specific Debugging
      - For issues in Docker environments, always check:
        - Container logs: `docker logs <container-name>`
        - Container status: `docker-compose ps`
        - Environment variables in docker-compose.yml
        - Volume mounts and file permissions
        - Network connectivity between containers
        - Business-specific environment configurations

      ## Multi-Tenant Debugging
      - Always verify which business context is active
      - Check if the issue occurs in all business contexts
      - Verify business-specific configuration is correctly loaded
      - Look for business context validation in API endpoints
      - Check for business-specific overrides of shared functionality
      - Test with different business-specific data sets
      - Verify plugin system is loading correct business modules

      ## Common Multi-Tenant Issues
      - Business context not being passed correctly
      - Plugin system not loading business-specific modules
      - Database queries not filtering by business context
      - Asset paths not resolving to correct business directories
      - Configuration not loading business-specific settings

      Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem, distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources, and then add logs to validate your assumptions. Explicitly ask the user to confirm the diagnosis before fixing the problem. Please record every solution and give me at the end a detailed log of all solved errors and instructions for a programming or debugging agent on how to solve these issues faster. A solutions pattern.
