# Architecture Principles

## Core Architecture Patterns

### 1. Multi-Tenant Architecture

#### Key Principles
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Use shared core infrastructure with business-specific extensions
- **Runtime Decoupling**: Environment variables determine feature activation
- **Independent Deployment**: Each business unit can deploy independently
- **Business Isolation**: Ensure complete separation of business data

#### Implementation Strategy
- Use a plugin system for modular feature development
- Define clear boundaries between shared and business-specific code
- Implement business context validation in all operations

### 2. Configuration Registry Pattern

This pattern enables dynamic selection of business-specific configurations:

```typescript
// Configuration registry with automatic fallback
export const configRegistry: Record<string, Config> = {
  businessA: businessAConfig,
  businessB: businessBConfig,
  businessC: businessCConfig,
  default: defaultConfig,
}

// Usage with business context detection
export const getConfigForBusiness = (business?: string): Config => {
  // Get business from context, default to 'default'
  const businessKey = business || 'default'
  
  // Return matching config or fall back to default
  return configRegistry[businessKey] || configRegistry.default
}
```

This pattern allows:
- Runtime selection of configurations based on business context
- Automatic fallback to default configuration
- Easy addition of new business configurations
- Type-safe configuration through TypeScript interfaces

### 3. Progressive Enhancement Strategy

Systems should follow a progressive enhancement strategy:

1. **Base Functionality**: Core functionality that works in all environments
2. **Enhanced Features**: Advanced features when dependencies are available
3. **Business Enhancement**: Domain-specific features on top of shared infrastructure

This ensures the system remains operational even when:
- External services are unavailable
- Business context is missing
- Certain components fail

### 4. Multi-Phase Development Approach

Complex features should be developed in distinct phases:

1. **Core Infrastructure**: Base collections, endpoints, and engines
2. **UI Layer**: Components and state management
3. **Integration Layer**: Connecting with external services and providers
4. **Business-Specific Implementations**: Tailored configurations for each business unit

This phased approach allows for:
- Clear development milestones
- Testable functionality at each stage
- Progressive enhancement from basic to advanced features
- Clear separation of concerns

## Architecture Guidelines

### Plugin Architecture

#### Plugin Types
- **Core**: Always active, fundamental functionality
- **Shared**: Cross-business features
- **Business-Specific**: Business-specific functionality

#### Ideal Plugin Structure
```
plugins/shared/feature-name/
├── README.md                     # Comprehensive documentation
├── index.ts                      # Plugin registration
├── collections/                  # Data models
├── components/                   # UI components
├── endpoints/                    # API endpoints
├── hooks/                        # Hooks for state management
├── services/                     # Core functionality
├── types/                        # TypeScript definitions
├── configs/                      # Configuration options
└── tests/                        # Testing infrastructure
```

### Error Handling Strategy

Systems should implement comprehensive error handling:

```typescript
try {
  // Primary approach
  const results = await this.generateResults(query)
  if (results.length > 0) {
    return results
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('Primary approach failed, falling back', error)
  // Log for monitoring but don't show to user
}

// Fallback approach
try {
  return await this.generateFallbackResults(query)
} catch (fallbackError) {
  console.error('All methods failed', fallbackError)
  throw new Error('Service unavailable at this time')
}
```

This ensures:
- Graceful degradation when services fail
- Multiple fallback options
- Transparent error reporting
- Consistent user experience

### Performance Optimization

#### Response Time Strategies

To achieve optimal response times:

1. **Efficient Database Queries**: Optimize WHERE clauses and use selective field projection
2. **Intelligent Caching**: Cache frequently accessed configurations and results
3. **Asynchronous Processing**: Use non-blocking operations for parallel execution
4. **Resource Pooling**: Implement connection pooling for databases and services
5. **Minimal Data Transfer**: Send only necessary data in responses

### Security Architecture

#### Authentication and Authorization
- Implement JWT-based authentication with role-based access
- Use field-level security for sensitive data
- Validate business context for all API endpoints

#### Data Protection
- Properly manage environment variables
- Implement separate configurations for different deployment environments
- Validate and sanitize all inputs

## Testing Strategy

### Multi-Layer Testing

Systems should implement a multi-layer testing approach:

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual components and functions
2. **Integration Tests**: Component interactions and API endpoints
3. **Business-Specific Tests**: Domain configuration validation
4. **End-to-End Tests**: Complete workflow testing

## Architectural Decision Records

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. **Document the Context**: What is the background for this decision?
2. **List Alternatives**: What other approaches were considered?
3. **Document Decision**: What approach was chosen and why?
4. **Document Consequences**: What are the implications of this decision?
5. **Update Documentation**: Ensure system documentation reflects the decision

## Implementation Quality Gates

All architectural implementations should:

- Handle edge cases and scale appropriately
- Achieve sub-200ms response times for interactive elements
- Follow design system and accessibility standards
- Have comprehensive test coverage (>80% for critical paths)
- Be configurable for different contexts
- Follow established patterns and conventions
